# Object Based Attention Through Internal Gating


## Abstract
Object-based attention is a key component of visual perception, relevant for perception, learning, and memory. Despite a rich set of experimental findings and theories, there is a lack of models of object based attention that work for non-trivial problems. Here we propose a model for visual object based attention which is built on recurrent dynamics and trained using gradient descent. The model is a recurrent convolutional U-Net architecture which simultaneously selectively attends to relevant input regions and features while preserving classification accuracy. Our model replicates a range of findings from neuroscience, including attention invariant tuning, sequential allocation,  and attention dependence of activities.
